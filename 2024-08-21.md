## Question 1

**Two hosts are connected with a point to point link. The data rate of the link is 100 Mbit/s and data is sent continuously. The minimum receive window size (so that the receive buffer does not run the risk of overflowing) is 10.000 byte. What is the RTT of the link? Show your calculation.**

The receive window size _W_ must be at least as large as the _Bandwidth-Delay Product_ (BDP) to prevent overflow. The BDP is the product of the data rate and the RTT.

> W = R × RTT

Solving for RTT:

> RTT = W / R = 80000 / 100000000 = 0.0008

Answer: 0.8ms

## Question 2

**A router has the following forwarding table for the same output port:**

| Network ID | Net mask |
| ---------- | -------- |
| 10.0.0.128 | /25      |
| 10.0.0.0   | /25      |
| 10.0.1.0   | /24      |
| 10.0.4.0   | /23      |
| 10.0.2.0   | /23      |

**First aggregate the table as much as possible and then answer the following question.**

**What is the id of the network to which the adress 10.0.1.14 belongs?**

_Answer in the example form 192.168.100.0 /24 or 192.168.100.0/255.255.254.0_

> The first entry in the original routing table will match with IP addresses of the type `00001010.00000000.00000000.1XXXXXXXX`. The second one, `00001010.00000000.00000000.0XXXXXXX`. These two entries can therefore be merged into just one entry covering that entire range: `00001010.00000000.00000000.XXXXXXXX`. This means only the first _24_ bits will identify the subnet, so the subnet mask of the merged entry is `/24`. With this merge, **we do not lose any coverage**.

> We can not merge any other network ID's as that would lead to losing coverage.

| Network ID | Net mask |
| ---------- | -------- |
| 10.0.0.0   | /24      |
| 10.0.1.0   | /24      |
| 10.0.4.0   | /23      |
| 10.0.2.0   | /23      |

As for the question, the IP address will match with our second entry, `10.0.1.0` and `/24`. Because of a subnet mask of `/24`, the network id is `10.0.1.0/24`.

## Question 3

**Router X has the following routing table:**

| Network | Hops | Next hop |
| ------- | ---- | -------- |
| Net2    | 6    | A        |
| Net3    | 4    | C        |
| Net4    | 3    | A        |
| Net6    | 2    | C        |
| Net7    | 3    | B        |

**It receives the following RIP update message from a neighbour D:**

| Network | Hops |
| ------- | ---- |
| Net2    | 1    |
| Net4    | 6    |
| Net5    | 1    |
| Net6    | 1    |
| Net7    | 5    |

**Fill in the following table with the new routing table X has and will advertise after the update. If a field is not applicable/not used fill in “N/A”.**

> The strategy is to compare the current paths we have with those we could create via our neighbour D. We should note however, that moving to D also means hopping once. In our case, we could create an entry to `Net5` and update our path to `Net2`.

| Network | Hops | Next hop |
| ------- | ---- | -------- |
| Net1    | N/A  | N/A      |
| Net2    | 2    | D        |
| Net3    | 4    | C        |
| Net4    | 3    | A        |
| Net5    | 2    | D        |
| Net6    | 2    | C        |
| Net7    | 3    | B        |

## Question 4

![Image of network](./images/2024-08-21-q4.png)

**Given the figure above. The host addresses are given below:**

`B = 192.168.1.11`\
`C = 192.168.1.12`\
`D = 192.168.1.13`

`X = 210.10.3.14`\
`Y = 13.85.34.123`\
`Z = 145.234.10.73`

**`N` is a router with an address translator with a single global external address.**

**Add partial entries to router `N`’s _NAPT table_ as the following events take place in numbered order in the sub questions below.**

_For known port numbers, insert the actual number and for port numbers taken from a list of available but non-allocated port numbers use “unused”. If an event cannot take place write “N/A”. Internal refers to the private network and external to the NAT’s public network side_

1. **NetAdmin configures port forwarding for HTTP to B**

> The internal IP address is the one used within the LAN (to the left of the router `N` in the picture). In our case, it'll simply be the IP address of `B`: `192.168.1.11`. The HTTP protocol defaults to port `80`, so the internal port will therefore be set to `80`. Port `80` is not in use externally, so it'll be set as the external port as well.

Internal IP Address: `192.168.1.11`\
Internal port: `80`\
External port: `80`

2. **Y opens up an SMTP connection to D**

> Here, an external host attempts to initiate a SMTP connection to host `D`. SMTP uses port `25`, for which we do not have a port forwarding rule for. From an external point of view, `D`'s IP address cannot be known as it is behind `N`.

N/A

3. **B opens up a HTTP connection to Z**

> The explanation I, with my loyal LLM instance, came to find was that when `B` tries to initiate a new HTTP connection with an external host (`Z`), a random unused port is selected internally and another random unused port is selected externally. In the new entry, they are mapped together with the internal IP address set to, you guessed it, `B`'s address `192.168.1.11`. Note that the internal and external port numbers don't have to be equal. They are randomly selected independantly and are mapped together with this new NAPT entry.

Internal IP Address: `192.168.1.11`\
Internal port: `unused`\
External port: `unused`

4. **Z opens up a HTTP connection to N**

> Here, an external host opens a HTTP connection to our router, `N`. By default, the port used from the external request will be `80`, since it's HTTP. Because of event 1, our router does have a port fortwarding rule for that port! This means that **no new entry is created**, but the traffic is directed to the IP address of host `B`, internal port `80`.

No new entry, but traffic directed (according to previously configured port forwarding rule) to `192.168.1.11:80` internally. External port: `80` (HTTP).

5. **X opens up a HTTP connection to N**

> Same logic as previous event applies here.

No new entry, but traffic directed (according to previously configured port forwarding rule) to `192.168.1.11:80` internally. External port: `80` (HTTP).
